# Illegal Fishing Detection - PDDL Scenarios

This repository contains **PDDL domain and problem files** for modeling illegal fishing detection scenarios for AI planning and goal recognition. The files are organized based on two research papers, each contributing different sets of scenarios.

# Repository Structure
**Scenarios**
- **`first-paper-scenarios/`**: Contains 11 problem files used in [Towards Explainable Goal Recognition Using Weight of Evidence (WoE): A Human-Centered Approach].  
- **`second-paper-scenarios/`**: Contains 8 problem files used in [Hypothesis-Driven Explainable Goal Recognition].  
- **`domain.pddl`**: Defines the predicates, actions, and constraints for illegal fishing detection. 

# Usage
1. Install a PDDL planner (e.g., Fast Downward, Metric-FF, or PDDL4J).
2. Run a scenario with the domain file:

3. Analyze the output to understand detected illegal fishing activities.
